Here are some of the benefits of Transmission:

  * Uses AIR 2.0's native process to execute a Java jar and communicate with the Java instance.
  * Gives you the ability to package a combination AIR and Java project with the AIR native installers rather than requiring you to create your own [as you had to in the past](http://natescodevault.com/?p=102)
  * AMF3 message exchange format for POJO object mapping.
  * Easier debugging for the Java side provided.  Rather than sending your System.out.println's across standard output, Transmission automatically writes them to a .transmissionLog.log file in the user home directory.
  * Better message detection.  When AMF bytes are sent across Transmission, a message length is included at the beginning of each message to better delineate multiple messages providing better stability.
